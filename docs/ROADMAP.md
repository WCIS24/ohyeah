# ROADMAP

TODO (planned end-to-end workflow):

- Data preparation and statistics
- Indexing: BM25 + dense + hybrid
- Baseline RAG (single-step retrieval)
- Multi-step retrieval (rule-based)
- Calculator (YoY / delta)
- Retriever contrastive fine-tuning (with hard negatives)
- Tuning scripts (grid / optuna)
- Paper outputs: tables and case exports
