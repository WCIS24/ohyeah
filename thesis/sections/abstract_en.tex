Complex financial queries often involve multiple years, entities, and explicit numerical reasoning. Conventional single-step retrieval with template generation tends to suffer from insufficient evidence coverage and arithmetic errors. This thesis builds a reproducible financial RAG system on the FinDER dataset without external LLM APIs, introducing rule-based multi-step retrieval and an explicit calculator with gating. Results show that retriever fine-tuning improves overall retrieval performance (full dev Recall@10: 0.3246→0.3772); multi-step retrieval remains non-degrading on the complex subset with a slight MRR gain; and calculator gating prevents numeric metric regression, providing a stable baseline for future improvement. All artifacts are traceable under outputs/.
